This artifact generates an OpenCMIS Client Bindings Jar that only works on 
IBM WebSphere 7.0.0.5 and later. It takes advantage of the JAX-WS implementation 
provided by WebSphere, reduces OpenCMIS’ dependencies and avoids potential
conflicts with the Suns JAX-WS implementation that is usually required
for OpenCMIS.

In order to use the OpenCMIS client library in a web application on WebSphere,
place the following jars into /WEB-INF/lib :

chemistry-opencmis-client-api-<version>.jar
chemistry-opencmis-client-impl-<version>.jar
chemistry-opencmis-client-binding-websphere-<version>.jar
chemistry-opencmis-commons-api-<version>.jar
chemistry-opencmis-commons-impl-<version>.jar
commons-codec-1.4.jar

Other dependencies mentioned in other parts OpenCMIS documentation are 
not required. Make sure that the standard OpenCMIS Client Bindings Jar
is not present.
